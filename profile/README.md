## **Project Overview**

RoutinA is an alarm-based morning routine management agent. This service aims to help people who want to form a morning routine but have difficulty sustaining it. We provide convenient features for planning and executing routines and offer continuous motivation to help users maintain their routines for longer.

## **The Problem We Solve**

* **Why:** Most people who try to form a morning routine struggle to maintain it consistently.
* **How:** We address this problem by encouraging users to perform their morning routines immediately after waking up and by providing continuous motivation.
* **What:** We implement this solution through an alarm-integrated morning routine management agent service. RoutinA not only offers convenient features for planning and performing routines but also consistently motivates the user.
